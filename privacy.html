    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how professional services and any related applications operated by
      <strong>Munir Uddin Ahmed</strong>, a DDA-licensed sole professional in the United Arab Emirates, collect, use, and
      protect personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Who is responsible for your data</h2>
    <p>
      The data controller is:
      <br />
      <strong>Name:</strong> Munir Uddin Ahmed
      <br />
      <strong>Business type:</strong> Sole Professional (Dubai Development Authority)
      <br />
      <strong>Country:</strong> United Arab Emirates
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>Depending on how you interact with my services or applications, I may collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic contact information, such as your name and email address when you contact me directly.</li>
      <li>
        Limited account information, such as name, email, and public profile details if you sign in via an external login
        provider (for example, Facebook Login), where explicitly used.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data, and I do not sell personal data to any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How your information is used</h2>
    <p>Your information may be used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To respond to inquiries and communicate about professional services or engagements.</li>
      <li>To provide access to applications or services where authentication or identification is required.</li>
      <li>To maintain the security and integrity of systems and services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Legal basis for processing</h2>
    <p>Where applicable, personal data is processed based on one or more of the following legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your consent, when you choose to provide information or use an external login provider.</li>
      <li>The necessity to perform a contract or pre-contractual steps related to professional services.</li>
      <li>Legitimate interests, such as securing systems and improving service quality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data sharing</h2>
    <p>
      I do not sell or rent your personal information. Data is only shared when necessary to operate services (e.g., hosting
      providers, email infrastructure), and such third parties are required to handle data securely and in accordance with
      applicable privacy laws.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      Personal data is retained only for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy
      Policy, or to comply with legal obligations. When data is no longer needed, it is securely deleted or anonymized.

      <li>The right to request deletion of your personal data, where applicable.</li>
      <li>The right to object to or restrict certain types of processing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To exercise these rights, you can contact me using the email address provided below. Reasonable efforts will be made to
      respond within a practical timeframe.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      Appropriate technical and organizational measures are used to protect personal data against unauthorized access, loss, or
      misuse. However, no system can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and you should take care when sharing information
      online.
    </p>

    <h2>9. External links and third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      Services or websites may contain links to external sites or rely on third-party integrations (such as external login
      providers). This Privacy Policy does not cover those third-party services, and you are encouraged to review their privacy
      policies separately.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how your data is handled, you can contact:</p>

        })();
      </script>
    </p>
